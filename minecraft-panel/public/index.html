    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>
      Over the years, I hosted different types of servers on my computer, including a good number of Minecraft Servers for me and my friends!<br><br>
      As much fun as it was, these setups often came with frustrating issues – from my computer going into sleep mode every 12 hours to security concerns due to open ports on my home network.<br><br>
      This is why this project involves deploying a Minecraft Java Edition multiplayer server in the cloud, using Amazon EC2.
      The goal is to have a stable and secure environment where me and some friends can play together in a shared survival world.<br><br>
      By hosting the server in the cloud, we avoid typical issues like limited bandwidth, downtime, or local security risks.
      The server runs on a Linux-based EC2 instance, manually configured for performance and port access.
      The Minecraft software is controlled via shell scripts and a web-based control panel, served from the same EC2 instance.
      <br><br>
      This project combines fun with functionality — giving me a chance to apply Linux, networking, and AWS cloud infrastructure skills together.
